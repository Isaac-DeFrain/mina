    # Re-clone the repo. This is necessary to avoid a bug (or design flaw) in
    # Nix flakes that requires the source directory to be in a particular state
    # (and to be a Git repository).
    git clone -b "$BUILDKITE_BRANCH" https://github.com/Granola-Team/mina.git mina

    # Use the Nix build (with logging) of that newly cloned repository.
    cd mina
